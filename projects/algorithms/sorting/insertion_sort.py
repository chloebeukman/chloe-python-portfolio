def insertion_sort(arr):
    """
    Sorts a list using the Insertion Sort algorithm.

    Arguments:
    arr (list): A list of numbers.

    Returns:
    list: The sorted list.

    Explanation:
    - Insertion Sort builds a sorted sequence one element at a time.
    - It shifts larger elements to the right to make space for the current element.
    - Best Case Time Complexity: O(n) (already sorted list).
    - Average & Worst Case Time Complexity: O(nÂ²).
    - Space Complexity: O(1) (in-place sorting).
    - Works well for small or nearly sorted datasets.
