def quick_sort(arr):
    """
    Sorts a list using the Quick Sort algorithm.

    Arguments:
    arr (list): A list of numbers.

    Returns:
    list: The sorted list.

    Explanation:
    - Quick Sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm.
    - It selects a pivot and partitions the list into elements smaller and greater than the pivot.
    - Recursively sorts the partitions.
    - Average & Best Case Time Complexity: O(n log n).
    - Worst Case Time Complexity: O(nÂ²) (when the smallest or largest element is always chosen as the pivot).
    - Space Complexity: O(log n) due to recursive calls.
