## Projects
### 1. Expense Tracker
- A **Tkinter-based** budget and expense tracking application.
- Uses **SQLite** for data storage.
- Features **goal tracking** and **data visualization**.

### 2. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Examples
- Demonstrates **inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism**.
- Includes Python class-based implementations.

### 3. Database Projects
- SQL scripts and queries for managing **structured data**.
- Demonstrates **CRUD operations, relationships, and indexing**.

### 4. System Architecture Patterns
- Examples of **MVC, layered architecture, and microservices**.
- Implementations using Python frameworks where applicable.

### 5. Algorithms & Data Structures
- Sorting and searching algorithms (e.g., **merge sort, quick sort**).
- Implementations of linked lists, stacks, and queues.
